    "### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern programming languages (e.g., Python, C++, Java) are object-oriented to varying degrees. By allowing programmers to create objects that encapsulate information and methods in natural ways, code can become much more readable and compact. It can also be more easily debugged. Below, I've written outlines for two new object types (classes) that could be used in a university registrar's office. The first defines a class to hold information about a course. The second holds information about a student, which includes the courses in which they're enrolled."
